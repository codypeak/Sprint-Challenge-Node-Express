# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?  an open source server environment. 

## What is Express?  it is a routing and middleware framework that is a series of function calls. 

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.  It allows us to use functions to execute HTTP requests, two examples of which are get, which retrieves information, and post, which allows new information to be inserted. 

## What is Middleware?  software that acts as a bridge between a database or os and applications that extends functionality.

## What is a Resource?  resources are intuitive subjects/categories that can help a developer organize and generate restful routes. 

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?  HTTP status codes in the 200 range, like 200 and 201. 

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?  we can create new files and route between them to keep components/functions separate, and more semantic/single use.

## What is express.json() and why do we need it?  it is a built in function in express that we need because it parses incoming requests with json and returns appropriate responses.
